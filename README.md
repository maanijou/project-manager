# project-manager

Managing your projects easily


## Devops

`docker` and `docker-compose` are used to handle docker images like a database. I used pgadmin for some database management tasks as well.

You can use `make` to run the images.

You have to define a `database.env` file in your root folder so that everything works fine. env files are usually some samples (`database.env.sample`) and should not be inside the repository. Here I just put that for your convenience!
